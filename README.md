# Python Network Scanner

Python script that lets you monitor your network and execute code when someone
connects

## Info

The file is fully documented in case you wish to change
stuff.

If you don't want to change anything then you can use it right away.
The script only outputs "names[1] is (/is not) connected" by default (provided
you entered the ip and name correctly).

## Ideas for use

* Start/turn off certain things at home when you arrive/leave.
* Notify you when someone connects (is home)
* Tell your refrigerator to pour you a glass of water (stay hydrated friends)

## Credit where credit is due

I edited the code from [Kalle Halden](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWr0mx597DnSGLFk1WfvSkQ) on youtube. The specific video is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imN-vhi5ZWQ&t).
